# Navigation Flow Update

## Summary
Updated the authentication navigation flow to properly navigate to the home screen after successful login or registration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Login Screen (`lib/screens/login_screen.dart`)
**Changes:**
- Added import for `home_screen.dart`
- Updated successful login flow to navigate to `HomeScreen` instead of showing a message
- Uses `pushAndRemoveUntil` to clear navigation stack and prevent back navigation to login

**Flow:**
```
Login → Success → Home Screen (removes all previous routes)
Login → Failure → Shows error message, stays on login screen
```

### 2. Registration Screen (`lib/screens/registration_screen.dart`)
**Changes:**
- Added import for `home_screen.dart`
- Updated successful registration flow to navigate to `HomeScreen` instead of going back to login
- Uses `pushAndRemoveUntil` to clear navigation stack

**Flow:**
```
Register → Success → Home Screen (removes all previous routes)
Register → Failure → Shows error message, stays on registration screen
```

### 3. Splash Screen (`lib/screens/splash_screen.dart`)
**Changes:**
- Added imports for `auth_provider.dart` and `home_screen.dart`
- Now checks authentication status using `isAuthenticatedProvider`
- Intelligently routes based on whether user is already logged in

**Flow:**
```
Splash → Check Auth Status
  ├─ If Authenticated → Home Screen
  └─ If Not Authenticated → Login Screen
```

## Complete User Journey

### First Time User
```
App Launch → Splash Screen → Login Screen → Register → Home Screen
```

### Returning User (Not Logged In)
```
App Launch → Splash Screen → Login Screen → Home Screen
```

### Returning User (Already Logged In)
```
App Launch → Splash Screen → Home Screen (Direct)
```

### Logout Flow (Future)
```
Home Screen → Logout → Login Screen
```

## Authentication Persistence

The app now properly persists authentication state using:
- **StorageService**: Saves user data and tokens locally
- **AuthProvider**: Checks login status on app start
- **Splash Screen**: Routes based on authentication state

### Benefits:
1. ✅ Users stay logged in after closing the app
2. ✅ Seamless navigation to home screen if already authenticated
3. ✅ Prevents unauthorized access to home screen
4. ✅ Clean navigation stack (no back button to login after successful auth)

## Security Features

1. **Protected Routes**: Home screen only accessible after authentication
2. **Token Persistence**: JWT tokens saved securely in shared preferences
3. **Auto Logout**: Can be implemented when token expires
4. **Remember Me**: Optional email persistence for convenience

## Navigation Methods Used

### `pushAndRemoveUntil`
Used when navigating from login/register to home:
```dart
Navigator.of(context).pushAndRemoveUntil(
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const HomeScreen()),
  (route) => false, // Removes all previous routes
);
```

**Why?**
- Prevents users from pressing back to return to login
- Clears the navigation stack for fresh start
- Standard practice for authentication flows

### `pushReplacement`
Used in splash screen:
```dart
Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const LoginScreen()),
);
```

**Why?**
- Replaces splash screen in the stack
- Users can't navigate back to splash
- Smooth transition between screens

## Testing the Flow

### Test Scenario 1: First Login
1. Launch app → See splash screen
2. Navigate to login screen
3. Enter credentials and login
4. See success message and navigate to home screen
5. Try pressing back → App should close (not go back to login)

### Test Scenario 2: Already Logged In
1. Close app (don't logout)
2. Launch app again
3. See splash screen
4. **Should directly navigate to home screen** (skipping login)

### Test Scenario 3: Registration
1. From login screen, tap "Register"
2. Fill registration form and submit
3. See success message and navigate to home screen
4. Try pressing back → App should close (not go back to register)

### Test Scenario 4: Failed Login
1. Enter invalid credentials
2. Press login
3. See error message
4. Stay on login screen (no navigation)

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Additions:
1. **Logout Functionality**
   - Add logout button in home screen/account section
   - Clear auth state and navigate to login
   
2. **Token Refresh**
   - Implement token refresh before expiration
   - Auto-logout on token expiration
   
3. **Session Timeout**
   - Auto-logout after inactivity
   - Configurable timeout duration
   
4. **Biometric Auth**
   - Fingerprint/Face ID for quick login
   - Store encrypted credentials
   
5. **Deep Linking**
   - Handle email verification links
   - Password reset links
   - Direct product links

## Code Quality

✅ No compilation errors
✅ No linter errors  
⚠️ Minor deprecation warnings (withOpacity) - cosmetic only
✅ Follows Flutter best practices
✅ Uses proper state management (Riverpod)
✅ Clean separation of concerns

## Files Modified

1. `lib/screens/login_screen.dart`
2. `lib/screens/registration_screen.dart`
3. `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart`

## Dependencies

No new dependencies added. Uses existing:
- `flutter_riverpod` - State management
- `shared_preferences` - Local storage (via StorageService)
- `flutter_screenutil` - Responsive design

## Backward Compatibility

✅ Fully compatible with existing authentication system
✅ No breaking changes to API calls
✅ Existing user data format unchanged
